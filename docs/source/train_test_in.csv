| Since for 'knn', 'glm', and 'gbm' we use the implementation of the
| Scikit Learn package1, all of the hyperparameters defined in this

| TensorFlow is used, and the list of supported hyperparameters is as

| 'hidden_layers_neurons', 'hidden_layers_activations',
| 'output_activation', 'loss', 'optimizer', 'metrics',
| 'early_stopping_monitor', 'early_stopping_patience', 'batch_size',
| 'validation_split','epochs']
| The structure of the neural network can be specified using
| 'hidden_layers_structure' which takes a list of two item tuples each
| corresponds to a hidden layer in a network with the first item of each
| tuple as the number of neurons in the layer and second item as the
| activation function of the layer.
| Another way is to specify 'hidden_layers_number',
| 'hidden_layers_neurons', and 'hidden_layers_activations' which will
| result in network with the number of hidden layers according to 
| 'hidden_layers_number' having the same activation function and number
| of neurons according to the values of 'hidden_layers_neurons' and
| 'hidden_layers_activations' parameters. The 'output_activation' hyper
| parameter is the activation function of the output layer. The
| supported values for the rest of the hyperparameters are the same as
| the TensorFlow package.
| 
| **example:** {'n_neighbors':10, 'metric':'minkowski'}
| {'hidden_layers_neurons':[2,4,8],
| 'hidden_layers_activations':['relu',None,'exponential']}"
